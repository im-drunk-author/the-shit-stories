# The God’s Answer

He had lived a life filled with endless questions, none of which seemed to have answers. His world felt like a never-ending torment, a place where every moment stretched into a burden too heavy to carry. To him, the earth wasn’t a paradise—it was hell. He couldn't understand why he was placed here, why he had to endure all of it. And so, he sought the one being who could give him the answers—the God who created everything.

One day, with all his frustration boiling over, he asked, "Why am I here? Why was I placed on this earth? To me, this is hell. Everything about it feels like suffering. Why would you do this to me?"

The God, with an all-knowing gaze, looked down upon him. "Oh, son, you think this is hell?" the divine voice rumbled. "What would you say if I were to place you in the true hell?"

The words struck him hard. For a moment, he was silent. Was this really as bad as it could get? What would be worse? His heart pounded with fear and confusion. He couldn't help but ask, "What more is there? After all this, am I to face something even worse?"

The God smiled—an expression that carried both tenderness and a touch of something much older, something wiser. And then, in the language the protagonist knew all too well, the God spoke:

"ഫാ പന്ന കഴുവേരി പുലയാടി മൈരേ നീ ഒക്കേ ഭൂമിയിൽ കണിച്ച് കൂട്ടിയതിന് നിന്നെ ഒക്കേ ഉണ്ടക്കിയ എനിക്ക് പറഞ്ഞാൽ മതി, മൈരേ നിന്നെ ഭൂമിയിൽ വിട്ടതേ എൻറെ തെറ്റ്, മിണ്ടാതെ ഇരുന്നോ കൊന്ന് കളയാം ഞാൻ."

The words hit him like a sudden storm, his mind spinning, grasping at their meaning. It wasn’t just the phrasing—it was the truth behind them that made his soul tremble.

He stood there, paralyzed, as the weight of the words settled in. The God had not answered him in the way he had hoped. No revelation. No comfort. No understanding. Only a reminder of his own helplessness.

He had always assumed life had purpose, that there was meaning hidden beneath the surface of his suffering. But now? Now, a terrible realization gnawed at him. What if the God’s words were true? What if life was nothing more than a random arrangement, a cosmic game played out without any real end? What if the pain he felt was simply the result of existing in a world that never asked for him, where he was merely a fleeting speck in an uncaring universe? What if the "hell" he was in wasn’t some external punishment, but the very fact of being, of consciousness itself?

And what if that ultimate "hell" wasn’t something to come, but was already here, in the very act of being alive, in the endless cycle of questioning, suffering, and searching for meaning that would never come?

As the God’s smile lingered, the protagonist felt a void growing within him. The truth—the real truth—was slipping through his grasp. Was there even a point to it all? Was life just a cruel joke, an eternal test with no answer? Was he the architect of his own hell? Was this all just a cosmic mistake?

He could not tell. The questions that once gave him purpose now twisted into a never-ending spiral of doubt. And the worst part? The silence that followed.

For the first time, he realized—he had no answers. And perhaps, there were none to be found.
