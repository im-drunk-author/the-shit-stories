Your phone buzzes gently, a soft reminder,  
To close your eyes and let your mind unwind, sir.  
It whispers softly, "The night's drawing near,  
Rest your weary soul, let go of your fear."

But do you really need to heed its call?  
Is sleep essential, or not at all?  
The screen shines bright, a tempting light,  
Yet your mind is racing, with thoughts taking flight.

Maybe tonight, you’ll stay awake a bit,  
In the quiet stillness, in a world of wit.  
But still, your phone urges with gentle might,  
“Close your eyes, and drift into the night.”

The choice is yours, to dream or delay,  
But remember, sleep might just make your day.  
So, listen to the phone, or let your will be free,  
Either way, tomorrow is waiting, you'll see.
