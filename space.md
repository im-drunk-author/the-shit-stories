# The Space 🧑‍🚀 🚀 🍺


When I’m drunk, I see the spaces in 4DX.
The place I’m sitting becomes the tesseract that I own.
I could walk into the room I want,
And I can slam the door as I wish,
The walls bend, twist,
And form new dimensions,
Flickering between thoughts and reality.

I move through corridors of color,
Where time has no hold,
And every step echoes in infinite ways.
I touch the sky,
And it answers me with the soft hum of possibility,
A universe that responds,
As if it, too, is mine.

For a moment, I’m more than flesh,
More than memory,
I am the door, the space, the time between.
I am both lost and found,
In the breath of a universe
That shifts and expands
With every blink of my eye.

And when the door slams behind me,
I laugh,
Knowing I’ve left nothing behind,
Only more to discover,
In the shifting, ever-widening world
I now control.
