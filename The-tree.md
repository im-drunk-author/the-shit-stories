# The Shit Tree, you cant cut down

The things you have thrown out your life into your garbage bag will out grow you, It will sprout in the bag without you even realizing it. It will shadow your present, will hide your sun, desperate to find the light, you will search for a solution, you wish you could cut the tree that had outgrown you. It is not physical, this tree cannot be cut down. it will remain there for the rest of your life.
