# The Tree in the Bag


The things we discard, the burdens we bury in the deep recesses of our lives, are never truly gone. Like seeds planted in the darkness, they grow unnoticed, their roots wrapping silently around our past. You throw away your pain, your regrets, your unspoken words into the invisible bag of your mind. And, in time, they begin to sprout.

At first, it’s subtle—an unfamiliar shift in the air, a quiet rustle of thoughts. You don’t notice how they grow, how they stretch and reach into your present. But one day, they will overshadow you. The things you thought you left behind will become a forest in the very bag you buried them in, a force that demands your attention, a shadow that hides your light.

You search for a way to remove them, to sever their hold. You wish you could simply cut them down, erase them from existence. But that’s the illusion. These aren’t things you can destroy. They are not physical, not trees of flesh and wood—they are emotional, psychological, and spiritual. They are part of you, woven into your very fabric.

No matter how hard you try, the tree will remain. It will follow you, grow with you, forever rooted in your soul. It will be a constant reminder, not of what you’ve lost, but of what you’ve failed to let go.

Perhaps, the greatest realization is that the tree isn’t your enemy. It’s not something to be fought, but something to be understood. It is the manifestation of your unresolved self, your hidden truth, forever growing with you. And though you may not be able to remove it, you can learn to live alongside it—gently bending with its presence, instead of fighting against its roots. In the end, it may not be the shadow that defines you, but how you choose to walk in its light.
