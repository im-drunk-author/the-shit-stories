# If I Could Go Back

If I could go back, to where we once stood,  
I’d mend the mistake, I’d change what I could.  
The words unsaid, the actions untaken,  
The silence that left our hearts left shaken.  

I’d hold onto you, before the slip,  
Before the silence, before the grip.  
Of regret that lingers, of time that flies,  
Before the goodbyes, before the lies.  

But time, unforgiving, doesn’t rewind,  
No undo button, no change to find.  
What’s lost is lost, a ghost in the past,  
A memory fading, too deep to last.  

Yet here I stand, with lessons learned,  
A heart that aches, yet slowly turned.  
I can’t go back, but I’ll carry you near,  
In every tear and every fear.  

For in the loss, there’s still a grace,  
A love that time cannot erase.  
I’ve learned to walk without you beside,  
But your memory, forever, will guide.
